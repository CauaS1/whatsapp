# WhatAapp
This project is a WhatsApp copy. In this update the pages are created dynamically.

## Before vs After 

<strong>Before:</strong> All of the project are only design, so if I had 15 differents people, I had the same `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image/>` 15 times  <br>
<strong>After:</strong> Now its all dynamically, where the 15 people are create only 1 time, with `<FlatList>`

## Pages

## What I Learned ?

I learned the basic,how to use functions, FlatList, use Modal and some other things, <br> but for me, it was a huge evolution compared to before.
